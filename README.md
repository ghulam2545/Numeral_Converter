< <b>Imp Note : </b> Due to uninstallation of Qt I lost UI interface design. >
<br><br>
It's a tiny school project, solution to an standard real world problem <b>Number Conversion System</b>.
<br>It can convert decimal-binary-octal-hexadecimal number each other(vice-versa).
<br><b>Limitation</b> - This converter ONLY deals with integer values not a fractional.
<br><br>
<b>How to try Output :</b>
Fork/Download this directory in your machine, go to output folder and you will find an zip file. Just extract this zip file in your machine and in Converter folder double click on Converter (an application type file).
Do not disturb other files.
<br><br>
<b>How to Contribute :</b>
In Hepler_method I have only_int_main.cpp file which has helper those are used in the project. main.cpp also contains some methods and are not used in project so <b>YOU</b> can contribute there helper method for fractional number also.
