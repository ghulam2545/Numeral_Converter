It's a tiny school project, solution to an standard real world problem <b>Number Conversion System</b>.
<br>It can convert decimal-binary-octal-hexadecimal number each other(vice-versa).
<br><b>Limitation</b> - This converter ONLY deals with integer values not a fractional.

<br><br>

## How to Contribute :
In Hepler_method I have only_int_main.cpp file which has helper those are used in the project. main.cpp also contains some methods and are not used in project so <b>YOU</b> can contribute there helper method for fractional number also.
